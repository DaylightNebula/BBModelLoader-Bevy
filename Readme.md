This is meant to be a simple project that uses a few packages to make a game engine that behaves like a browser would.
By this I mean that the game engine can download code and assets from the online realm and run them as needed.

UI can easily be done with Belly.  A package that allows for simple creation of UI via .eml and .ess (basically just html and css) (https://github.com/jkb0o/belly/tree/main)

Goals:
 - Allow users to quickly create entities in json files with components and tasks.
 - Allow users to quickly create scenes using a collection of these entities.
 - Allow users to write custom components or entity tasks or scene behaviours using javascript.

Todolist:
- [ ] .entity file
  - [ ] Components
  - [ ] Tasks
